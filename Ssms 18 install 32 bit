Perfect! 👍 Here’s a step-by-step guide to install and fully set up SSMS 18.x on your Windows 10 (32-bit) machine.


---

🟢 Step 1: Download SSMS 18.x (32-bit)

1. Go to Microsoft’s official download page:
Download SSMS 18.12.1 (last 32-bit version)


2. The download will start automatically – you will get a file like:
SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe (~600 MB).




---

🟢 Step 2: Install SSMS 18.x

1. Run the installer (right-click → Run as administrator recommended).


2. In the SQL Server Installation Wizard, click Install.

No need to change the default path unless you want a custom installation folder.



3. Wait for installation to finish.

It usually takes 5–10 minutes depending on system speed.



4. Click Close when it says “Setup Completed Successfully”.

🟢 Step 3: Install / Configure SQL Server (if not installed)

SSMS is just a management tool – you also need a SQL Server instance to connect to.

1. If you already have SQL Server installed, skip this step.


2. Otherwise:

Download SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition (free) from Microsoft:
Download SQL Server Developer Edition

Run installer → Choose Basic or Custom installation.

Follow on-screen instructions until setup completes.





---

🟢 Step 4: Open and Connect

1. Launch SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from Start Menu.


2. In Connect to Server dialog:

Server type: Database Engine

Server name: Choose your local instance (e.g., localhost or .\SQLEXPRESS).

Authentication: Windows Authentication (default)



3. Click Connect – you should see Object Explorer with your databases.

🟢 Step 5: First-Time Setup / Best Practices

✅ Change Theme

Tools → Options → Environment → General → Choose Blue/Light/Dark theme.


✅ Enable Line Numbers in Query Editor

Tools → Options → Text Editor → Transact-SQL → General → Check Line Numbers.


✅ Create a Sample Database
Run this in a new query window:

CREATE DATABASE TestDB;
GO
USE TestDB;
GO
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    Department NVARCHAR(50)
);
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (1, 'Jasim', 'DevOps');
SELECT * FROM Employees;

You should see your first result table. 🎉

🟢 Step 6: Optional Extras

Install SQL Server Sample Databases like AdventureWorks for practice.

Configure IntelliSense (Tools → Options → Text Editor → Transact-SQL → IntelliSense).

Enable Auto-Save / Query History (available under Tools → Options).



---

✅ Summary:

Download SSMS 18.12.1 → Install → Install SQL Server (if needed) → Connect and start using.

SSMS 18 is the last version supporting Windows 10 32-bit.
