To learn data analytics in 110 days, you need a structured plan that balances theory, practical skills, and hands-on projects. This roadmap assumes you're starting with little to no prior knowledge and can dedicate 3–5 hours daily. It covers key areas: foundational skills, tools, techniques, and real-world application. Adjust based on your pace and prior experience.
