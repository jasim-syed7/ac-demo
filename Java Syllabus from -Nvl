Perfect! You have listed a complete Java full-stack learning path from basics to real-time projects.
Let’s structure it into a day-wise learning roadmap so you can follow step by step and master it.

I’ll create a clear, progressive plan with theory + coding practice + mini-projects.

Java Full-Stack Learning Roadmap

Phase 1 – Core Java (Day 1 – Day 40)

Focus: Learn Java fundamentals + OOPs + collections + multithreading.

Day	Topic	What to Do

1-2	Java Introduction	History of Java, JDK/JRE/JVM, platform independence, installation (JDK + IDE like IntelliJ/Eclipse)
3-4	Language Fundamentals	Identifiers, keywords, literals, data types, variables, naming conventions
5-6	Datatypes & Type Casting	Primitive vs non-primitive, type casting (implicit/explicit), wrapper classes
7-8	Arrays	1D, 2D arrays, array methods, for-each loop
9	Types of Variables	Local, instance, static variables
10	Var-args Parameters	Method overloading with var-args
11-12	Main Method & Command Line Arguments	main() method signature, args[], writing programs that accept CLI inputs
13	Java Coding Standards	Naming conventions, indentation, commenting, clean code
14-16	Operators	Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, instanceof
17-20	Flow Control	if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while), break, continue
21-23	Declarations & Access Modifiers	public, private, protected, default, static, final, abstract
24-28	OOPS Concepts	Classes, objects, methods, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism (overloading/overriding), abstraction, interfaces
29-31	Strings	String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, common methods, immutability
32-34	Exceptions	try-catch-finally, throw/throws, custom exceptions
35-38	Multithreading	Thread class, Runnable, synchronization, inter-thread communication
39-40	Collections	List, Set, Map, Iterator, Generics, Comparable/Comparator

Phase 2 – Advanced Java (Day 41 – Day 60)

Focus: Build real applications with Java EE features.

Day	Topic	What to Do

41-44	Serialization	Serializable interface, transient keyword
45-48	Java 8 Features	Lambda, Streams API, Functional Interfaces, Optional, Date/Time API
49-52	JDBC	Connect to DB, CRUD operations, PreparedStatement, Transactions
53-55	JSP	Basics, directives, scripting elements, JSTL
56-58	Servlets	Lifecycle, doGet/doPost, request/response handling
59-60	Mini Project 1	Build a small CRUD app using Servlets + JSP + JDBC



---

Phase 3 – Frameworks (Day 61 – Day 90)

Focus: Learn Hibernate + Spring + Spring Boot.

Day	Topic	What to Do

61-65	Hibernate	ORM basics, configuration, annotations, CRUD, HQL
66-72	Spring	Core, IOC, Dependency Injection, AOP
73-80	Spring Boot	Auto configuration, REST controllers, profiles, JPA
81-85	Microservices	Architecture, communication (REST, Feign), Eureka, Config Server
86-90	Mini Project 2	Build RESTful Microservice using Spring Boot + JPA + H2/MySQL



---

Phase 4 – Deployment & Real-Time (Day 91 – Day 120)

Focus: End-to-end project + deployment.

Day	Topic	What to Do

91-95	RESTful APIs	HTTP methods, status codes, Postman testing
96-100	Security & Validation	Spring Security, JWT authentication
101-105	Build Tools	Maven/Gradle, CI/CD intro
106-110	Unit Testing	JUnit, Mockito
111-115	Real Time Project Workshop	Full-stack project: Backend (Spring Boot + REST), Frontend (Optional React/Angular), DB (MySQL)
116-120	Deployment	Deploy to Tomcat, Dockerize, deploy to AWS/Cloud

Would you like me to prepare a detailed day-wise schedule (120 days) with subtopics, coding exercises, and small practice tasks for each day so you can follow step by step?
This will be like a study timetable + coding practice tracker.
