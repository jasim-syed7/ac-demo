📊 Weekly Routine Example

Day Time Allocation Focus Area
Monday 10 hours Core Java + Coding
Tuesday 10 hours Spring Boot APIs
Wednesday 10 hours Microservices Implementation
Thursday 10 hours Front-End Development
Friday 10 hours DevOps & Deployment
Saturday 10 hours Project Work
Sunday 5 hours Review & Planning

💡 Key Tips for Success

1. Consistency Over Intensity: Avoid burnout with balanced sessions .
2. Hands-On Practice: Build 3-4 portfolio projects (e.g., API-driven apps, cloud-deployed microservices).
3. Community Engagement: Join Java/Spring communities (e.g., roadmap.sh ) for support.
4. Iterative Learning: Use the "Skill Sprint" method —focus on 20% of concepts that deliver 80% of results (e.g., Spring Boot for backend, React for front-end).
