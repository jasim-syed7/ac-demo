### Action Plan to Master Skills for the Job in 150 Days

Based on the JD you provided (4+ years equivalent in Java, Spring Boot, API development, microservices, front-end technologies, APIs for mobile apps, and end-to-end app development), I'll outline a structured, day-wise plan. This assumes you have basic programming knowledge (e.g., beginner Java). If you're already intermediate in some areas, you can accelerate those sections. The plan is intense: 10 hours/day, divided roughly as 4 hours theory/learning (videos/books/tutorials), 4 hours hands-on coding/practice, and 2 hours review/debugging/projects.

**Key Principles:**
- Use free resources: Oracle Java docs, Spring official tutorials, freeCodeCamp, GeeksforGeeks, Baeldung, YouTube (e.g., freeCodeCamp, Amigoscode for Spring, Traversy Media for front-end).
- Tools: Install JDK 17+, IntelliJ IDEA (Community edition), VS Code for front-end, Postman for APIs, Git for version control.
- Daily routine: Start with review of previous day (30 mins), then learning, coding, end with notes/summary.
- Track progress: Maintain a GitHub repo for all code/projects. Build 3-5 mini-projects throughout.
- Weekly milestones: End each week with a small project or quiz to test mastery.
- Health: Take breaks (Pomodoro: 50 mins work, 10 mins break). Sleep well; burnout kills progress.
- Job focus: Tailor to India market (e.g., practice for companies like Infosys, TCS, Accenture; emphasize LeetCode for interviews).

The plan is divided into phases for manageability, with day-wise breakdowns. Total: 150 days (about 5 months).
