That’s a great question 👍 — let’s break it down clearly.

To become a Python Automation Testing Engineer using Selenium and Pytest, you don’t need to master all of Python — but you must be strong in the core parts that directly help in test automation.

Here’s the exact Python syllabus you should focus on 👇


---

🧠 1. Python Basics (Foundation)

These are must-know:

Variables, Data types (int, float, string, list, tuple, dict, set)

Type casting (int(), str(), etc.)

Input/output functions (print(), input())

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, membership)

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Loops (for, while)

break, continue, pass usage


✅ Why: You’ll use these in test case logic and data-driven testing.


---

⚙️ 2. Functions

Defining and calling functions

Return values

Function arguments (*args, **kwargs)

Lambda (anonymous) functions


✅ Why: Most test cases and fixtures are wrapped in functions.


---

🧩 3. Data Structures

Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets (CRUD operations)

List comprehensions

String operations and slicing


✅ Why: For handling test data, parameterization, and response validation.


---

🧱 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and objects

__init__ constructor

Inheritance and polymorphism

Encapsulation and abstraction

super() and class variables

Composition (object inside object)


✅ Why: You’ll structure Selenium test scripts using Page Object Model (POM), which depends on OOP concepts.


---

🧰 5. File Handling

Reading/writing text, CSV, JSON, and XML files

Using with open() as f:

OS and Path modules (os, pathlib)


✅ Why: For reading test data, writing logs, and storing results.


---

🔍 6. Exception Handling

try, except, finally, raise

Custom exceptions


✅ Why: For gracefully handling Selenium failures (e.g., element not found).


---

🧪 7. Modules and Packages

Importing built-in and custom modules

Understanding __init__.py

Virtual environments (venv)


✅ Why: For organizing test projects and dependencies cleanly.


---

🧭 8. Advanced Concepts (Basic Level)

Decorators (used in Pytest fixtures)

Generators and Iterators (basic understanding)

Command-line arguments (sys.argv)


✅ Why: Pytest uses decorators like @pytest.fixture and parameterization.


---

💡 9. Libraries useful for Testing

Selenium: For web automation

Pytest: For test execution, fixtures, parameterization, reports

Requests: For REST API testing (optional but useful)

logging: For logs

time, datetime, random, json, os, re: Common utilities in automation



---

🧱 10. Framework Knowledge

Combine Python + Selenium + Pytest to build:

Test structure (setup, teardown)

Page Object Model (POM)

Test data-driven framework

Reporting (HTML reports, Allure)

CI/CD integration (Jenkins, Git)



---

🔁 Learning Order Recommendation

Phase	Topics	Duration

Phase 1	Python basics + loops + functions	7–10 days
Phase 2	OOP + File handling + Exceptions	7 days
Phase 3	Selenium (locators, waits, actions)	10–15 days
Phase 4	Pytest (fixtures, parametrize, reports)	7 days
Phase 5	Framework + CI/CD practice	10–15 days


Total: ~45 days (1.5 months) with daily practice.

Would you like me to create a day-wise 45-day learning plan (Python + Selenium + Pytest) with daily topics and small tasks?
That’ll help you stay consistent and job-ready.
